      Blink 182 Miss You: I miss you, miss you Hello there The angel from my
      nightmare The shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting
      victim Of darkness in the valley We can live like Jack and Sally if we
      want Where you can always find me And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
      And in the night we'll wish this never ends We'll wish this never ends I
      miss you, I miss you I miss you I miss you Where are you? And I'm so sorry
      I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick
      strange darkness Comes creeping on so haunting every time And as I stared
      I counted The Webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their
      insides Like indecision to call you And hear your voice of treason Will
      you come home and stop the pain tonight Stop this pain tonight Don't waste
      your time on me You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I
      miss you) Don't waste your time on me You're already the voice inside my
      head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me You're already
      the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on
      me You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't
      waste your time on me You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you,
      I miss you) Don't waste your time on me You're already the voice inside my
      head (I miss you, I miss you) I miss you, I miss you I miss you, I miss
      you I miss you, I miss you I miss you, I miss you

      Saturday night and you're still hangin' around Tired of living in your one
      horse town You'd like to find a little hole in the ground For awhile... So
      you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans And you stare at the junkies
      and the closet queens It's like some pornographic magazine And you smile
      Captain Jack will get you high tonight And take you to your special island
      Captain Jack will get you by tonight Just a little push, and you'll be
      smilin' Oh yeah, ... Your sister's gone out, she's on a date You just sit
      at home and masturbate Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't
      wait For that call So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes
      And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes Ah, but still
      your fingers gonna pick your nose After all... So you decide to take a
      holiday You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet Ah, there
      ain't no place to go anyway What for? So you got everything, ah, but
      nothing's cool They just found your father in the swimming pool And you
      guess you won't be going back to school Anymore. So you play your albums,
      and you smoke your pot And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot Oh
      but still you're aching for the things you haven't got What went wrong?
      And if you can't understand why your world is so dead Why you've got to
      keep in style and feed your head Well you're 21 and still your mother
      makes your bed And that's too long
