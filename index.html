    <p>Blink 182 Miss You: 
        I miss you, miss you
        Hello there 
        The angel from my nightmare
        The shadow in the background of the morgue
        The unsuspecting victim 
        Of darkness in the valley
        We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
        Where you can always find me
        And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
        And in the night we'll wish this never ends
        We'll wish this never ends
        I miss you, I miss you
        I miss you I miss you
        Where are you?
        And I'm so sorry
        I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
        I need somebody and always
        This sick strange darkness
        Comes creeping on so haunting every time
        And as I stared I counted
        The Webs from all the spiders
        Catching things and eating their insides
        Like indecision to call you
        And hear your voice of treason
        Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
        Stop this pain tonight
        Don't waste your time on me 
        You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
        Don't waste your time on me 
        You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
        Don't waste your time on me 
        You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
        Don't waste your time on me 
        You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
        Don't waste your time on me 
        You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
        Don't waste your time on me 
        You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
        I miss you, I miss you
        I miss you, I miss you
        I miss you, I miss you
        I miss you, I miss you
